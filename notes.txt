if need be. 
 
Track Type Please select one category that best suits your upload to help our user  
 
discover your sound.

(?) will display text when cursor is over it explaining each selection 
 
Clean Or Explicit - Optional for the user to click off (Will be in form of a checkbox)  
 
Will show up on song page if selected. 
 
Tagging 
 
If a remix is selected I want a box to open up for them to type in the original song  
 
title, it will be as if they are tagging the remix to that title. This will be similar to how  
 
hash tagging works on social media (there can be space in between words). As the  
 
user begins to type the title similar titles will begin to populate under the box. Any  
 
other users that uploads remixes to the same title will show up on the bottom of the  
 
tracks page. Similar to how DMP works when we add remixes to a pre existing  
 
original track. they will show up at the bottom of the track page in order from most  
 
popular to least popular. Popularity is determined by how many downloads or clicks  
 
the download button has received as it can either be a direct download or a link to a  
 
secondary site to download the track. 1 download or click per IP address. 
 
If a cover song is selected i would also like the same tagging option offered, if a cover  
 
song has the same title, they will show up at the bottom of the track page in ranked  
 
order from most popular to least popular. Popularity is determined by how many  
 
downloads or clicks the download button has received as it can either be a direct  
 
download or a link to a secondary site to download the track. 1 download or click  
 
per IP address. 
 
Note: the user will only be allowed to tag 1 song per upload. 
 
Genre (Drop down box displaying genres) depending on the Track Type category  
 
that is selected the genres will be different 
 
Download Users will have 2 options to offer there track for download. If they do not  
 
select either option the track will not be available for download. 
 
1. They can offer direct downloads from Zoundstream (Limited to 100 for non  
 
subscribers) After 100 times the user will not be able to offer there track for  
 
direct download from our server unless they subscribe. An upgrade button  
 
should display near the download option. 
 
2. User will enter a link to a secondary site. 
 
The user will be able to name the download button [Optional] (It will default on the  
 
word “download” if the user does not enter anything. 
 
Private (If the user selects private the track will not show up in the new release  
 
section, most downloaded, top downloads, top rated, or search engine. The uploader  
 
will be given a link to give to the track to individual people they wish to) [Optional]  
 
THIS CAN BE MOVED TO 2ND RELEASE IF TIME CONSUMING 
 
Description (Text) [Optional] 
 
Meta tags (user must enter at least one) 
 
Note: (when the track is uploaded the preview should be converted to 96kbs) Full  
 
track that is uploaded will play.
